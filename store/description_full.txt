Create Locale/Tasker actions to apply specific sync settings.

This is not a standalone app!
In order to use this app, you need an application that uses the locale API like Locale or Tasker.
You might also be able to create launcher shortcuts with some launchers.

Available actions:
- Master sync on/off/toggle
- Specified account/data auto sync on/off/toggle/sync now/force sync now
