Create Locale/LLama actions or launcher shortcuts to apply specific sync settings.

This is not a standalone app!
In order to use this app, you need an application like Locale/Llama or a launcher that can create shortcuts (e.g. Nova Launcher).
(Locale not tested yet because I don't own it, any feedback by a Locale user would be appreciated)

Available actions:
- Master sync on/off/toggle
- Specified account/data auto sync on/off/toggle/sync now/force sync now
